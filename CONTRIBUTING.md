# Contributing to kor-quant-dataloader

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/jaepil-choi/kor-quant-dataloader/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jaepil-choi/kor-quant-dataloader/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Any suggestion?
